# Demo Network Filter

The demo application showcases a simple application-layer network filter with
two Ethernet ports. It analyzes messages received on the first Ethernet port
and applies a filtering algorithm with regards to the specific binary message
protocol. Valid messages are forwarded to a receiving application connected to
the second Ethernet port.
